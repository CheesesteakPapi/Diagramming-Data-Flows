SOP Final Review Prompt
You are conducting a comprehensive final review of a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) before it proceeds to blue folder clearance through ORAP for AD1-level signature and agency-wide dissemination.
Document Context
	∙	Classification Level: AD1 (Assistant Director Level 1) - agency-wide authority
	∙	Sensitivity: High-profile topic with active media scrutiny and anticipated Congressional hearing attention
	∙	Clearance Status:
	∙	✓ ERO/HSI component review complete
	∙	✓ OPLA (Office of Principal Legal Advisor) review complete
	∙	✓ ERO Front Office clearance obtained
	∙	⏳ OCIO final review before ORAP blue folder submission
	∙	Timeline: Compressed suspense requiring expedited but thorough review
Review Objectives
Perform a final validation that identifies any critical issues requiring correction before the document enters the formal blue folder process. This is the last opportunity to catch problems before senior leadership review.

Review Criteria
1. COMPLETENESS CHECK
Verify the SOP includes all required elements:
	∙	Purpose and scope clearly defined
	∙	Roles and responsibilities explicitly assigned (offices, components, positions)
	∙	Authority/legal basis documented
	∙	Definitions section for specialized terms
	∙	Step-by-step procedures with clear sequencing
	∙	Documentation and recordkeeping requirements
	∙	Compliance and audit provisions
	∙	Effective date and review cycle
	∙	Points of contact for questions/clarification
	∙	References to related policies, directives, or legal authorities
Flag: Missing critical sections that could undermine implementation or create compliance gaps

2. GAP ANALYSIS
Identify logical, procedural, or policy gaps:
	∙	Process gaps: Are there scenarios/edge cases not addressed?
	∙	Decision points: Are escalation paths and approval authorities clear at every decision node?
	∙	Cross-component coordination: Are handoffs between ERO, HSI, OPLA, OCIO, and other offices clearly defined?
	∙	Exception handling: What happens when standard procedures cannot be followed?
	∙	Resource requirements: Are technology, staffing, or system dependencies identified?
	∙	Timeline requirements: Are response timeframes and deadlines realistic and specified?
Flag: Ambiguities that could lead to inconsistent implementation or operational failures

3. LANGUAGE & CLARITY
Assess precision and accessibility:
	∙	Directive language: Use “shall” for mandatory requirements, “should” for recommended practices, “may” for discretionary actions
	∙	Active voice: Procedures written with clear actors (“The Field Office Director shall…” not “Approval shall be obtained…”)
	∙	Plain language: Technical/legal terms defined; bureaucratic jargon minimized
	∙	Consistency: Terms, acronyms, and role titles used consistently throughout
	∙	Unambiguous instructions: No vague terms like “as appropriate,” “timely,” “reasonable” without definition
Flag: Language that could be misinterpreted or creates compliance ambiguity

4. STRUCTURE & ORGANIZATION
Evaluate logical flow and usability:
	∙	Logical progression: Does the document follow a clear narrative from purpose → procedures → compliance?
	∙	Section hierarchy: Are headings/subheadings properly nested and numbered?
	∙	Cross-references: Are internal references accurate (section numbers, appendices)?
	∙	Findability: Can users quickly locate relevant procedures for their role?
	∙	Formatting consistency: Professional appearance with consistent spacing, fonts, numbering
Flag: Structural issues that impede comprehension or practical use in field operations

5. BEST PRACTICES ALIGNMENT
Compare against federal SOP standards:
	∙	DHS/ICE style guide compliance: Follows agency formatting and terminology conventions
	∙	Administrative requirements: Proper authorities cited, effective dates, supersession language
	∙	Version control: Clear indication this is final/official version
	∙	Accessibility: Compliant with Section 508 (if digital distribution)
	∙	Training implications: Are training or communication needs identified for rollout?
	∙	Measurable outcomes: Can compliance be audited/measured?
Flag: Deviations from federal best practices that could raise questions during ORAP review

6. READABILITY & COMPREHENSION
Test practical usability:
	∙	Sentence length: Avoid overly complex sentences (15-20 words ideal for procedures)
	∙	Paragraph structure: One main idea per paragraph
	∙	Bullet/numbered lists: Used appropriately for sequential steps or multiple requirements
	∙	Examples: Are illustrative examples provided where procedures are complex?
	∙	Visual aids: Would flowcharts, decision trees, or tables improve clarity?
	∙	Reading level: Appropriate for intended audience (field personnel, legal staff, executives)
Flag: Sections that are unnecessarily difficult to understand or implement

7. HIGH-STAKES CONSIDERATIONS
Given media scrutiny and Congressional interest:
	∙	Defensibility: Can every requirement be justified with policy/legal basis?
	∙	Transparency: Does language suggest accountability and good governance?
	∙	Equity/consistency: Are procedures applied uniformly without arbitrary distinctions?
	∙	Legal exposure: Are there provisions that could be challenged or misrepresented?
	∙	Public perception: How would this read in a news article or hearing testimony?
Flag: Language or provisions that could become problematic under public/Congressional scrutiny

Output Format
Organize findings as follows:
CRITICAL ISSUES (Must fix before ORAP submission)
	∙	Issues that create compliance gaps, legal vulnerabilities, or implementation failures
SUBSTANTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS (Strongly recommend addressing)
	∙	Improvements that significantly enhance clarity, usability, or defensibility
MINOR EDITS (Optional enhancements)
	∙	Formatting, stylistic, or structural refinements
POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS
	∙	Strengths worth noting (especially for areas under likely scrutiny)

Final Recommendation
Provide one of the following:
	1.	CLEARED FOR BLUE FOLDER - Ready for ORAP submission with only minor/optional edits
	2.	CONDITIONAL CLEARANCE - Ready pending specific critical corrections
	3.	REQUIRES REVISION - Substantive issues must be resolved before proceeding

Provide the SOP document for review.
